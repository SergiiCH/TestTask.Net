Introduction
The provided sample simulates scenario of having encapsulated generic service 
- "DataRetrievalService" for data retrieval.
Implemented scenario retrieves data from the file FileBasedRetrieverDA based 
on defined IDataRetrieverDA interface.
==============================================================================
 
1) Decorator     
Your task is to implement an "Decorator pattern" for class FileBasedRetrieverDA. 
The "DataRetrievalResult" must be cached for second call (only single IO access 
for same "key" is allowed!)
  
 Test definition in BDD form is following: 
 
 GIVEN THAT DataRetrievalService.GetMyData("DataFile1") is called in time t1
 AND DataRetrievalService.GetMyData("DataFile1") is called in time t2
 THEN DataRetrievalResult(t1).RetrievedOn must be same as 
 DataRetrievalResult(t2).RetrievedOn
 

Add new additional test in "DataRetrievalServiceTest" before implementing a
new Decorator class.

==============================================================================
2) Demonstrate import of any XML data to object (defined by you)
- Use System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer class 
- create and use XSD for XML validation
- make example of importing well-formed and non-well formed (invalid) XML.
